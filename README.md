What the Project Does

This project is an interactive p5.js sketch that uses multiple modes to explore different visual and interactive behaviors. The user can switch between modes using number keys, turning the sketch into a small creative playground rather than a single animation.

Modes

Mode 1 (Key 1) – Background: Focuses on background visuals such as color changes or ambient motion.

Mode 2 (Key 2) – Objects: Displays animated shapes or objects on the canvas.

Mode 3 (Key 3) – Interaction: Responds to user input like mouse clicks.

Mode 4 (Key 4) – Patterns: Creates repeated or procedural visual patterns.

Design Process

The sketch was designed by separating ideas into modes to keep the code organized and easy to expand. Keyboard controls were added first for simple navigation, then visuals were refined through experimentation with motion, color, and interaction.
The goal was to create a vibrant and chaotic enviroment, with tons of contrast and "visual vomit" to encourage the eye to move around the canvas more
